🎯 Core Concept
A blockchain system that automates profit tax collection using quarterly business reports 
(the same data companies already provide to investors) with integrated Zero-Knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving tax compliance.

# 🏗️ Technical Architecture
### Blockchain Layer - MultiversX

✅ Advantages:

* Very low transaction fees
* Built with Rust (performance & security)
* Extensive documentation

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Layer
Privacy-Preserving Tax Compliance
Each quarter, businesses upload two distinct reports:

1.Internal Report ("Bilanț Contabil")

* Contains all internal transactions
* Processed through ZK proof algorithm
* Verified by tax authority (ANAF)
* Result: Pass/Deny (without exposing transaction details)


2.Public Report

* General business metrics: profit, operational costs, etc.
* Used for automated tax calculation
* Transparent and auditable

🔧 Key Components
1. Government Registry

* Multiple governments can register on the blockchain
* Each sets their own profit tax brackets and rates
* Example Structure:
*     10% for profits ≤ $50K
      15% for profits > $50K ≤ $500K
      20% for profits > $1M



2. Business Registration

* Companies register with their jurisdiction/government
* Link to their government's tax bracket system
* Store business metadata and tax obligations

3. Quarterly Reporting System

* Businesses submit profit data from quarterly investor reports
* Leverages existing legally required investor reporting
* Anti-fraud mechanism: Reduces tax evasion since lying to investors has severe legal consequences

4. Automated Tax Calculation

* Smart contracts apply progressive tax brackets to reported profits
* Automatic calculation and collection each quarter
* Transparent, immutable tax records

5. Tax Distribution

* Collected taxes automatically transferred to appropriate government wallets
* Complete audit trail of all payments
* Real-time transparency for public funds

6. Zero-Knowledge Verification Layer

#### Privacy Goal: Verify tax compliance without exposing sensitive business data
Process:
* Business generates ZK proof of internal report validity
* Tax authority (ANAF) verifies proof without seeing raw data
* Approval/rejection based on cryptographic verification
* Public report used for tax calculation only if internal report passes
