# Blockchain-Based System for combating Tax Evansion in modern businesses

---

## üéØ Core Concept

A blockchain system that automates profit tax collection using quarterly business reports (the same data companies already provide to investors) with integrated Zero-Knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving tax compliance.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
**MultiversX**
- ‚úÖ **Advantages**: 
  - Very low transaction fees
  - Built with Rust (performance & security)
  - Extensive documentation

### Frontend Layer
- **React + TypeScript** (primary choice)
- Modern, responsive UI for businesses and tax authorities

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Layer
**Privacy-Preserving Tax Compliance**

Each quarter, businesses upload two distinct reports:

1. **Internal Report ("Bilan»õ Contabil")**
   - Contains all internal transactions
   - Processed through ZK proof algorithm
   - Verified by tax authority (ANAF for Romania)
   - Result: Pass/Deny (without exposing transaction details)

2. **Public Report**
   - General business metrics: profit, operational costs, etc.
   - Used for automated tax calculation
   - Transparent and auditable

## üîß Key Components

### 1. Government Registry
- Multiple governments can register on the blockchain
- Each sets their own profit tax brackets and rates
- **Example Structure**:
  - 10% for profits ‚â§ $50K
  - 15% for profits > $50K ‚â§ $500K  
  - 20% for profits > $1M

### 2. Business Registration
- Companies register with their jurisdiction/government
- Link to their government's tax bracket system
- Store business metadata and tax obligations

### 3. Quarterly Reporting System
- Businesses submit profit data from quarterly investor reports
- Leverages existing legally required investor reporting
- **Anti-fraud mechanism**: Reduces tax evasion since lying to investors has severe legal consequences

### 4. Automated Tax Calculation
- Smart contracts apply progressive tax brackets to reported profits
- Automatic calculation and collection each quarter
- Transparent, immutable tax records

### 5. Tax Distribution
- Collected taxes automatically transferred to appropriate government wallets
- Complete audit trail of all payments
- Real-time transparency for public funds

### 6. Zero-Knowledge Verification Layer
- **Privacy Goal**: Verify tax compliance without exposing sensitive business data
- **Process**: 
  1. Business generates ZK proof of internal report validity
  2. Tax authority (ANAF) verifies proof without seeing raw data
  3. Approval/rejection based on cryptographic verification
  4. Public report used for tax calculation only if internal report passes
