## üö® What is wrong with the way we do business nowadays?

The digital transformation of commerce and the shift away from traditional monetary systems have fundamentally altered how businesses operate and interact with regulatory frameworks. However, these changes have exposed critical inefficiencies in government oversight and tax collection systems, creating concerns among technology professionals and policy experts alike.
The modern economy faces several systemic challenges that demand innovative solutions:

- üìà **Tax Evasion and Misreporting**: Businesses frequently manipulate financial statements by underreporting profits and inflating expenses to minimize tax obligations. This widespread practice costs governments billions of dollars annually in lost revenue, ultimately forcing higher tax rates and increased inflation that disproportionately burden ordinary citizens and compliant businesses.
- üèõÔ∏è **Inefficient Tax Collection Infrastructure:**: Traditional tax authorities in most countries rely on outdated bureaucratic systems that require extensive human resources and manual processes. These agencies could be streamlined through automated systems managed by small teams of specialized engineers, significantly reducing operational costs while improving collection efficiency and freeing up government resources for critical investments in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and innovation.
- üîí **Data Privacy Vulnerabilities**: Current audit processes force businesses to surrender sensitive financial information to demonstrate compliance, creating security risks and exposing proprietary data to potential misuse.

## üí° Solution

The emergence of blockchain technology and cryptographic advancements presents an opportunity to revolutionize tax collection systems. By implementing a decentralized, automated approach, we can address the fundamental issues plaguing traditional tax frameworks while maintaining transparency and accountability.
The proposed solution addresses each identified problem through technological innovation:

- ‚úÖ **Algorithmic Verification**: Automated systems eliminate human bias and corruption possibilities in tax assessment and collection. This ensures consistent application of tax laws across all businesses, reducing disputes and creating a more equitable system for taxpayers and governments alike.
- üîê **Zero-Knowledge Privacy Protection**: Implementation of Zero-Knowledge proof algorithms allows businesses to verify tax compliance without exposing sensitive transaction data. This maintains competitive advantages while ensuring regulatory compliance, eliminating the current trade-off between privacy and transparency.
- ‚ö° **Smart Contract Automation:**: Automated calculation and transfer systems handle tax collection instantly upon transaction completion. This reduces administrative overhead, eliminates collection delays, and ensures governments receive tax revenue in real-time rather than waiting for quarterly or annual filings.
- üìä **Integration with Existing Infrastructure:**: The system requires businesses to upload cryptographic proofs of invoices directly onto the blockchain. This creates an immutable record of all transactions while leveraging existing invoice generation processes that companies already use. This approach minimizes implementation friction and reduces additional compliance burdens on businesses while ensuring complete transaction transparency and traceability.
- üåê **Scales Globally**: Customizable tax brackets and rules accommodate different jurisdictions and tax systems. This enables international businesses to operate seamlessly across borders while ensuring each government receives appropriate tax revenue according to their specific requirements.

## üéØ Core Concept

A blockchain system that automates profit tax collection using quarterly business reports (the same data companies already provide to investors) with integrated Zero-Knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving tax compliance.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer

**MultiversX**

- ‚úÖ **Advantages**:
  - Very low transaction fees
  - Built with Rust (performance & security)
  - Extensive documentation

### Frontend Layer

- **React + TypeScript** (primary choice)
- Modern, responsive UI for businesses and tax authorities

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Layer

**Privacy-Preserving Tax Compliance**

Each quarter, businesses upload two distinct reports:

1. **Internal Report ("Bilan»õ Contabil")**

   - Contains all internal transactions
   - Processed through ZK proof algorithm
   - Verified by tax authority (ANAF for Romania)
   - Result: Pass/Deny (without exposing transaction details)

2. **Public Report**
   - General business metrics: profit, operational costs, etc.
   - Used for automated tax calculation
   - Transparent and auditable

---

## üîß Key Components

### 1. Government Registry

- Multiple governments can register on the blockchain
- Each sets their own profit tax brackets and rates
- **Example Structure**:
  - 10% for profits ‚â§ $50K
  - 15% for profits > $50K ‚â§ $500K
  - 20% for profits > $1M

### 2. Business Registration

- Companies register with their jurisdiction/government
- Link to their government's tax bracket system
- Store business metadata and tax obligations

### 3. Quarterly Reporting System

- Businesses submit profit data from quarterly investor reports
- Leverages existing legally required investor reporting
- **Anti-fraud mechanism**: Reduces tax evasion since lying to investors has severe legal consequences

### 4. Automated Tax Calculation

- Smart contracts apply progressive tax brackets to reported profits
- Automatic calculation and collection each quarter
- Transparent, immutable tax records

### 5. Tax Distribution

- Collected taxes automatically transferred to appropriate government wallets
- Complete audit trail of all payments
- Real-time transparency for public funds

### 6. Zero-Knowledge Verification Layer

- **Privacy Goal**: Verify tax compliance without exposing sensitive business data
- **Process**:
  1. Business generates ZK proof of internal report validity
  2. Tax authority (ANAF) verifies proof without seeing raw data
  3. Approval/rejection based on cryptographic verification
  4. Public report used for tax calculation only if internal report passes
