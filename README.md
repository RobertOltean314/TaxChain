## What I consider being wrong with the way we do business nowadays?

The digital transformation of commerce and the shift away from traditional monetary systems have fundamentally altered how businesses operate and interact with regulatory frameworks. However, these changes have exposed critical inefficiencies in government oversight and tax collection systems, creating concerns among technology professionals and policy experts alike.
The modern economy faces several systemic challenges that demand innovative solutions:

- **Tax Evasion and Misreporting**: Businesses frequently manipulate financial statements[^investopedia] by underreporting profits and inflating expenses[^investopedia] for multiple reasons[^jsheld], one of which is to minimize tax obligations[^brookings].These practices cost governments billions of dollars in lost revenue annually[^brookings], ultimately leading to higher tax rates. On the other hand, higher taxes lead to higher tax evasion, and the vicious loops goes on[^nber]. Over time, these dynamics put greater pressure on all social classes and legitimate businesses.[^brookings].
- **Tax Law Ambiguity and Its Consequences**: The lack of clear and concise tax laws often leads to legal ambiguities, differing interpretations, and the emergence of new circumstances that fall outside existing regulations. As a result, there are gray areas where it becomes difficult to distinguish between "tax avoidance" and "tax evasion"[^brookings]. Taxpayers—particularly large corporations with access to sophisticated legal and financial advisors—frequently exploit these uncertainties to minimize their obligations while remaining within the boundaries of the law, or at least appearing to do so. Meanwhile, tax authorities are left to interpret and enforce increasingly complex regulations that may not adequately address international trade or emerging technologies[^illegal-btc]. This legal ambiguity not only undermines public trust in the tax system but also creates an uneven playing field, where honest individuals and small businesses end up bearing a big share of the tax burden.
- **Inefficient Tax Collection Infrastructure**: Tax agencies around the world are responsible for collecting revenue to support essential public services such as transportation, education, and healthcare. However, many of these institutions continue to rely on outdated bureaucratic systems, some of which were built using programming languages that are no longer used today. A notable example is the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which still operates core systems written in COBOL—a language few developers learn or use today[^gao].
- **Data Privacy Vulnerabilities**:
- **Corruption**:

## Solution

The emergence of blockchain technology and cryptographic advancements presents an opportunity to revolutionize tax collection systems. By implementing a decentralized, automated approach, we can address the fundamental issues plaguing traditional tax frameworks while maintaining transparency and accountability.
The proposed solution addresses each identified problem through technological innovation:

- **Algorithmic Verification**: Automated systems eliminate human bias and corruption possibilities in tax assessment and collection. This ensures consistent application of tax laws across all businesses, reducing disputes and creating a more equitable system for taxpayers and governments alike.
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy Protection**: Implementation of Zero-Knowledge proof algorithms allows businesses to verify tax compliance without exposing sensitive transaction data. This maintains competitive advantages while ensuring regulatory compliance, eliminating the current trade-off between privacy and transparency.
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automated calculation and transfer systems handle tax collection instantly upon transaction completion. This reduces administrative overhead, eliminates collection delays, and ensures governments receive tax revenue in real-time rather than waiting for quarterly or annual filings.
- **Integration with Existing Infrastructure**: The system requires businesses to upload cryptographic proofs of invoices directly onto the blockchain. This creates an immutable record of all transactions while leveraging existing invoice generation processes that companies already use. This approach minimizes implementation friction and reduces additional compliance burdens on businesses while ensuring complete transaction transparency and traceability.
- **Scales Globally**: Customizable tax brackets and rules accommodate different jurisdictions and tax systems. This enables international businesses to operate seamlessly across borders while ensuring each government receives appropriate tax revenue according to their specific requirements.
