### Blockchain layer: 
* ETH:
    - avantaje: ecosistem mai mare, mai multa documentatie si tutoriale
    - dezavantaje: high fees, have to learn Solidity
* MultiversX:
    - avantaje: fees foarte mici, foloseste Rust, documentatie multa
    - dezavantaje: nu la fel de mare precum ETH, nu sunt atat de multe tutoriale video

 ### Front-End Layer:

 - React + Typescript (cel mai probabil)
  
### Core Concept
A blockchain system that automates profit tax collection using quarterly business reports (the same data companies already provide to investors).

### Key Components
1. Government Registry
- Multiple governments can register on the blockchain
- Each sets their own profit tax brackets and rates
- Example: 10% for profits â‰¤$50K, 15% for >500K, 20% for >$1M.

2. Business Registration
- Companies register with their jurisdiction/government
- Link to their government's tax bracket system
- Store business metadata and tax obligations

3. Quarterly Reporting System
- Businesses submit profit data from their quarterly investor reports
- Same numbers they're already legally required to provide investors
- Reduces tax evasion since lying to investors has severe consequences

4. Automated Tax Calculation
- Smart contracts apply progressive tax brackets to reported profits
- Automatic calculation and collection each quarter
- Transparent, immutable tax records

5. Tax Distribution
- Collected taxes automatically go to appropriate government wallets
- Clear audit trail of all payments


### Implementation Phases:
Phase 1: Basic single-government, single-business proof of concept

Phase 2: Multi-government registration system

Phase 3: Full quarterly reporting and tax calculation

Phase 4: Dashboard and reporting features
